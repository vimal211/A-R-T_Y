# ARTY


This application is the combination of social media and e-commerce. Basically it was inspired from <strong>dribbble.com</strong> 
<ul>
  <li>Dribble is mostly used by Graphic Designers to show case their works.</li>
  <li>Where as the concept of ARTY is similar to that where real world aritst who create Painting arts, Pencil art, etc. publish their works to the outer world.</li>
  <li><h3>It was just a frontend application as I developed this to implement my learnings in Frontend Development</h3></li>
</ul>
